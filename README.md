# Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of steganography to securely hide and extract confidential messages within images. By leveraging advanced encryption techniques and a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI), this project aims to provide an effective solution for secure data transmission while maintaining the integrity of the cover image.

## Features
- **Interactive and Responsive GUI**: A user-friendly interface created using `tkinter` that allows users to easily embed and extract secret messages.
- **Advanced Encryption**: Utilizes AES (128 Bit) encryption to secure the secret message before embedding it into the image.
- **Double Protection**: The secret message is first encrypted using a password and then hidden within the image.
- **Versatile**: Supports different image formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG).

## Technology Used
- **Libraries**: PIL, OS, Hashlib, Tkinter, filedialog, messagebox
- **Language**: Python 3
- **System Configuration**:
  - Operating System: Windows 10 or above
  - Processor: AMD 5500U
  - RAM: 16 GB 
  - Software: Visual Studio Code
